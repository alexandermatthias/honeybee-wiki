The following table provides an overview of material in this guide, which assumes basic knowledge of Rhino, but zero knowledge of Grasshopper, Ladybug or Honeybee. Complete novice users should begin with the Intro sections. Intro I covers installation, Intro II provides bare minimum knowledge of the Grasshopper interface, and Intro III provides a little background on how Ladybug and Honeybee function differently than many other Grasshopper plugins. Advanced users may want to begin with the process of creating an Energy model, or Step 1.
