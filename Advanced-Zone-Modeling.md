_Note: it is possible to apply distinct materials to each zone surface as well. There are two methods of doing this: 1) building up the zones surface-by-surface as in the following: or 2) Creating the zones through Mass-to-Zones and then using the Honeybee_Set EP Zone Construction component to specify materials for each zone surface type. You can view these types using the Honeybee_Label Zone Surfaces component._
